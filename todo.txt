1. Only keep a max of 1,000,000 artists in Spotify (use LRU eviction policy)
2. Don't index artists without related artists or top tracks or who have 0 popularity
3. Store only related artists for each artist
    - artist => set of related artists (NOT PICKLE)
    - Use RedisGraph: https://oss.redislabs.com/redisgraph/commands/#variable-length-relationships
4. Keep sets of artist ids for each genre
    - Make this a sorted set based on popularity
5. Use get_artists in spotify_indexer to cut down on Spotify API calls
6. When a small playlist is built, notify user and tell them to make their criteria less specific
7. Only one artist per playlist
8. Use MySQL to store artist tracks (track_id, artist_id, danceability, tempo, release_year)
9. When celery task is done, update the task's state with the playlist's size
10. Retry failed celery tasks using: http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/tasks.html#retrying
11. Cache user top artist/genres in session
12. Allow for logging out
13. DOCKERIZE!

Questions

- So many steps. How to simplify for user? Combine multiple steps into one form?
- What are some interesting things to show the user in the UI?
    - Their top genres
    - Their top artists (short/medium/long-term)
    - Avails - but Is this feasible?
- Use react native for mobile app?
